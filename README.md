# Visualizing Housing Market Trends using Tableau

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing housing market data and transforming raw housing datasets into meaningful visual insights using Tableau dashboards and stories. The objective of this project is to help users understand housing market trends, analyze key factors affecting sale prices, and present insights through interactive visualizations.

The system uses Tableau Desktop for data visualization, Tableau Public for cloud hosting, and Flask for web integration. This enables users to access dashboards through a web interface and interact with housing data easily.

This project was developed as part of a Data Analytics Internship using Tableau.

* HTML
* CSV Dataset
* GitHub

---

## Dataset

Dataset used: Transformed_Housing_Data2.csv

The dataset includes important housing features such as:

* Sale Price
* House Age
* Renovation Status
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Floors
* Basement Area

The dataset was loaded into Tableau Desktop and used to create visualizations and dashboards.

---

## System Architecture Overview

The system consists of the following layers:

Data Layer
The housing dataset stored in CSV format is used as the primary data source.

Visualization Layer
Tableau Desktop is used to analyze the dataset and create charts, dashboards, and stories.

Cloud Layer
Tableau Public is used to publish and host dashboards online.

Web Integration Layer
Flask is used to embed the Tableau dashboard into a web application.

User Layer
Users access the dashboard through a web browser and interact with visualizations.

---

## Dashboard Components

The Tableau dashboard includes:

* KPI indicators such as total houses and average sale price
* Bar charts for feature comparison
* Pie charts for distribution analysis
* Feature-based housing analysis charts
* Interactive filters for dynamic data exploration

These components help users understand housing market trends effectively.

## Flask Web Integration

The Tableau dashboard is integrated into a Flask web application using iframe embedding. This allows users to access and interact with the dashboard directly from the web interface.

Flask files are located in:

Project Development Phase/Flask/

Key file:
app.py – runs the Flask web application
